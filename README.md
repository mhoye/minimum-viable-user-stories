# A Minimum Viable Set Of Vulnerable User Stories

This is a list of vulnerable user stories. The goal of this exercise is 
to provide developers with a way to reason about the risks or challenges a
user may face as they navigate a difficult life that has your software in it.

This list not meant to be comprehensive; while I believe minimalism plays a part
in keeping this list and the motivations behind it accessible, additions are 
welcome. 

I also believe that this is approximately the lowest possible bar you can set for
yourself if you want to think of yourself a responsible developer.
